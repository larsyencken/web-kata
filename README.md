# Web kata

Small, self-contained sites and services, written as a form of deliberate practice on web skills. Consider implementing them yourself, and comparing.

## Web services

A simple URL shortener without auth. Post a URL to `/create` to get a shortened version back. Otherwise, shortened URLs should serve an HTTP 302 redirect and anything else should 404.

Implementations in: *Python*, *Clojure*
